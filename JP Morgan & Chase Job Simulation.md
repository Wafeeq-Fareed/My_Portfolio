# Portfolio Overview

Iâ€™ve completed three projects that highlight my skills in **data science** and **data analysis** with **security** as the key concept. I developed a <u>spam email classifier</u> using machine learning, <u>processed and analyzed CSV data</u> for insights, and conducted a security risk <u>analysis on mobile money transactions</u> to identify potential fraud. Each project involved data preprocessing, feature extraction, and visualization, demonstrating my ability to handle complex datasets and derive actionable insights.

## 1. Spam Email Classification using Machine Learning
- Description: Developed a robust machine learning model to classify emails as spam or ham. Leveraged Python's libraries for text processing, feature extraction, and classification. This project highlights the entire workflow, from data preprocessing and model training to feature importance analysis.

- Key Skills:

Text Preprocessing: Implemented custom text cleaning functions to standardize email content.
Machine Learning: Used Logistic Regression to build and evaluate a spam classifier.
Feature Analysis: Identified key words that differentiate spam from ham emails.
- Technologies: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

## 2. CSV Data Handling and Analysis
- Description: Worked extensively with CSV files, focusing on loading, processing, and analyzing data using Pandas. This project showcases various data manipulation techniques, such as filtering, aggregation, and visualization, which are crucial for deriving insights from structured datasets.

- Key Skills:

Data Loading and Cleaning: Demonstrated proficiency in handling and cleaning CSV files.
Data Analysis: Performed complex operations like grouping, aggregating, and sorting data to extract meaningful information.
Visualization: Created clear and informative plots to visualize data trends and patterns.
- Technologies: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib

## 3. Mobile Money Security Risk Analysis
- Description: Analyzed a dataset related to mobile money transactions to identify potential security risks. Focused on understanding and visualizing the relationship between various transaction features and the occurrence of fraud. The project involved creating functions for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis.

- Key Skills:

Data Preprocessing: Filtered and transformed transactional data to prepare it for analysis.
Risk Analysis: Explored correlations between account balance changes and fraud detection, helping identify potential security vulnerabilities.
Visualization: Generated scatter plots and bar charts to illustrate key findings in the data.
- Technologies: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib

# Conclusion
Each project demonstrates a different aspect of data science and machine learning, from text classification to structured data analysis and risk assessment. Together, they highlight a strong foundation in data handling, model development, and result interpretation, supported by effective visual communication of insights.
